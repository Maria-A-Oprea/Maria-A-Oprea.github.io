As typical in dynamical analysis, an essential goal is to study the long-term behavior of these systems. In this work, we present two different novel approaches for studying these systems. The first approach is based on constructing an analog of the Frobenius-Perron (transport) operator for hybrid systems. Rather than tracking the evolution of a single trajectory, this operator encodes the asymptotic nature of an ensemble of trajectories. The second approach presented applies to an important subclass of hybrid systems, mechanical impact systems. We develop an analog of Lie-Poisson(-Suslov) reduction for left-invariant impact systems on Lie groups. In addition to the Hamiltonian (and constraints) being left-invariant, the impact surface must also be a right coset of a normal subgroup. This procedure allows a reduction from a 2n-dimensional system to an (n+1)-dimensional one. We conclude the paper by presenting numerical results on a diverse array of applications.</p> </div> </div> </td><td><div class="click-to-reveal"> <button onclick="toggleContent()">Cite</button> <div id="hidden-content" style="display: none;"> <p>```

However, the classical theorem assumes that the underlying system is deterministic and that observations are noise-free, limiting its applicability in real-world scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we rigorously establish a measure-theoretic generalization that adopts an Eulerian description of the dynamics and recasts the embedding as a pushforward map between probability spaces. Our mathematical results leverage recent advances in optimal transportation theory. Building on our novel measure-theoretic time-delay embedding theory, we have developed a new computational framework that forecasts the full state of a dynamical system from time-lagged partial observations, engineered with better robustness to handle sparse and noisy data. We showcase the efficacy and versatility of our approach through several numerical examples, ranging from the classic Lorenz-63 system to large-scale, real-world applications such as NOAA sea surface temperature forecasting and ERA5 wind field reconstruction.</p> </div> </div> </td><td><div class="click-to-reveal"> <button onclick="toggleContent()">Cite</button> <div id="hidden-content" style="display: none;"> <p>```@misc{botvinickgreenhouse2024measuretheoretictimedelayembedding,

The sought-after quantity is a probability distribution of the unknown parameter, that produces data that aligns with measurements. Consequently, these problems are naturally framed as stochastic inverse problems. In this paper, we explore three aspects of this problem: direct inversion, variational formulation with regularization, and optimization via gradient flows, drawing parallels with deterministic inverse problems. A key difference from the deterministic case is the space in which we operate. Here, we work within probability space rather than Euclidean or Sobolev spaces, making tools from measure transport theory necessary for the study. Our findings reveal that the choice of metric -- both in the design of the loss function and in the optimization process -- significantly impacts the stability and properties of the optimizer.</p> </div> </div> </td><td><div class="click-to-reveal"> <button onclick="toggleContent()">Cite</button> <div id="hidden-content" style="display: none;"> <p>```@misc{li2024stochasticinverseproblemstability,

Our approach is inspired by that of NODEs and extends earlier neural DDE models, which have assumed that the value of the delay is known a priori.

It turns out that in optimal control problems, not only can they not be avoided, but are sometimes required in synthesizing the solutions.

In this work, we focus on mechanical systems with controls added to the symplectic form rather than the Hamiltonian. In practice, this translates to controlling the magnetic field for an electrically charged system. We develop a basic theory deriving necessary conditions for optimality of such a system subjected to nonholonomic constraints.

Abstract: We develop a geometric interpretation for solutions to the Bolza problem in optimal control for systems subject to hybrid dynamics. In particular, the idea of a hybrid Lagrangian submanifold is introduced. These submanifolds are invariant under the hybrid Hamiltonian flow arising from the extended maximum principle for hybrid systems. Solutions to the hybrid optimal control problem are characterized from backward propagating these submanifolds under the hybrid Hamiltonian flow. This approach side-steps issues of multi-valuedness and singularities. This paper ends with a brief example of the controlled bouncing ball to illustrate the theory.
